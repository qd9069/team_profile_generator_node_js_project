![badge of MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-9cf)

## Description
The Team Profile Generator is a Node.js command-line application that helps to generate an HTML page for a software engineering team after taking inputs from users. 

The application starts with prompting questions for the team manager, then provides an option to select which type of team members to add to the team. The user can select engineer or intern, then the associated questions will be displayed based on the type of team member that has been selected. User also has the option to stop adding more member to the team. 

Once all of the questions/prompts have been completed, an HTML page will be generated based on the user inputs in the dist/ folder.
